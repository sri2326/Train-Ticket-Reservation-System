- Bootstrap: For responsive design and pre-styled components to ensure the website looks good on all devices.

2. Back-End Development
- Java [J2EE]: For building the server-side application.
- JDBC: For connecting the Java application to the database.
- Servlet: For handling client requests and responses on the server side.
- Oracle ( SQL ): For storing and managing the data related to users, trains, bookings, etc.

-Performance: Optimize the system to handle multiple users simultaneously and provide quick response times.
-Scalability: Design the system to scale with increasing user load and data volume.
-Reliability: Ensure the system is reliable with minimal downtime and robust error handling.
System Design Overview
-Architecture:
-Multi-tier Architecture: Separate the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer for better manageability and scalability.
-Database Design: Use a relational database (Oracle SQL) to store user, train, and booking data with proper normalization and relationships.

**User Interface:**
Responsive Design: Ensure the website is accessible on various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) using Bootstrap.

**Integration:**
Payment Gateway: Integrate a secure payment gateway for handling online transactions.
By following this structured approach, you can develop a robust and efficient Train Ticket Reservation System that meets the needs of both users and administrators.
